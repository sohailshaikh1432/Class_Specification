# Class_Specification

• A <b>Class</b> can be considered as a blueprint using
which you can create as many objects as you
like.

• <b>Objects</b> have state and behaviour

• <b>Abstraction</b> is a process where you show only
“relevant” data and “hide” unnecessary
details of an object from the user.

• <b>Encapsulation</b> simply means binding object
state(fields) and behaviour (methods)
together. If you are creating class, you are
doing encapsulation.

• <b>Association</b> establishes relationships
between two Objects so as to enable Method
Invocation
